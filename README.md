# Spanshgin

## Howto
1. Plot your route on https://spansh.co.uk
2. Copy the route URL above ^
3. Plot!
4. When you jump to a system on the route, the plugin will copy it for you: just open the map and paste it.

## Notes:
- Routes get stale quickly: replot on Spansh if the plotting here fails.
- If you feed a route and you are not in a system on that route, you may have to copy the next system manually as the plugin has
to assume the first system in the route is the desired one. To avoid this replot the route on Spansh from your current system. This is ONLY needed if you plot a route in the plugin and you are NOT on the route.
- To refresh settings changed from EDMC, you have to close and reopen Spansh-gin window.
